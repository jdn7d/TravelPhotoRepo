## TravelPhotoRepo

# Description 
Influenced by my love of travel, this is an app to store and organize your travel photos. After creating a user account, you may create trips and add photos to the corresponding trip. You can view other users profiles and see any of their trips and photos that they have made public.

Users are able to signup / login. Browse through the exhibits, species and animals. They can make a donation to help the conservation of a species.

# Usage
To use this app:
1. clone
2. run 'bundle install'
3. run 'rails db:migrate' 
4. run 'rails db:seed'
5. run 'rails s'

# Stretch Goals

There are many features I would like to add to this app .
1. Ability to bulk add photos for quicker trip gallery creation (Didn't implement yet because I wanted the ability to add a category for each photo)
2. Filtering feature to search photos by category
3. A friends model and association to give users the ability to add friends and see a feed of their friends trips. 
4. Allow to save to the cloud, for example, Google or Amazon A3
5. OmniAuth for easier signup and signin
6. Styling!
7. Not a stretch goal, but next time I will implement TDD rather than adding tests at the end
